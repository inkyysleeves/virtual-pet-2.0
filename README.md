in this project i will be looking at going over what i have previously learnt at manchester codes, 
in this i will be doing test driven development whilst making a virtual pet that can:

be given a name

They can get older

As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit

You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness. 🏃‍♂️

You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger. 🍕

You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking

If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀

If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢
